Installation
Configure your Ubuntu repositories
Configure your Ubuntu repositories to allow "restricted," "universe," and "multiverse." You can follow the Ubuntu guide for instructions on doing this.

Setup your sources.list
Setup your computer to accept software from packages.ros.org.


sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu $(lsb_release -sc) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'
Set up your keys
sudo apt install curl # if you haven't already installed curl
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ros/rosdistro/master/ros.asc | sudo apt-key add -
Installation
First, make sure your Debian package index is up-to-date:

sudo apt update

Desktop-Full Install: (Recommended) : Everything in Desktop plus 2D/3D simulators and 2D/3D perception packages

sudo apt install ros-noetic-desktop-full
Environment setup
You must source this script in every bash terminal you use ROS in.


source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash
It can be convenient to automatically source this script every time a new shell is launched. These commands will do that for you.

Bash


If you have more than one ROS distribution installed, ~/.bashrc must only source the setup.bash for the version you are currently using.


echo "source /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

    To make sure that the download is correct, we put 
    roscore
